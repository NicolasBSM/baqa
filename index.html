        <h1>Despite Encouraging Downward Trend, U.S. Covid Deaths Remain High</h1>

         Coronavirus cases are trending downward across the United States as the countryâ€™s 
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html">vaccine rollout</a>
         picks up speed. But despite the large drop in new infections since early this year, the U.S. death rate remains at nearly 1,500 people every day. That number still exceeds the summer peak, when 
         <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/10/us/houston-hospital-coronavirus.html">patients filled Sun Belt hospitals</a>
         and outbreaks in 
         <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/09/us/coronavirus-cases-reopening-trends.html">states that reopened early</a>
         drove record numbers of cases, though daily deaths nationwide remained lower than the first surge last spring. The number of new reported cases per day remains nearly as high as the summer record.
